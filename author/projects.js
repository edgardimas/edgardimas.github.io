    detail: `This was my first application utilizing my software engineering skills. I developed a system that receives requests from a Hospital Information System (HIS) and translates them into a format that can be understood by a Laboratory Information System (LIS). This application acts as a bridge between the two systems, ensuring smooth and accurate communication within the healthcare workflow.`,

    detail:
      "Led the end-to-end deployment of the LIS, including system configuration, user requirement gathering, test mapping, and training. Facilitated seamless bridging between the LIS and laboratory instruments, ensuring compatibility and accurate data exchange. Collaborated closely with medical technologists and IT teams during UAT (User Acceptance Testing) and go-live support.",

    detail:
      "In this project, I successfully linked a clinical analyzer, the Cobas C311, with the Laboratory Information System (LIS). The integration allowed test orders and results to be transmitted automatically between the LIS and the analyzer, reducing manual entry and minimizing human error. I configured the communication protocol, validated data mapping, and ensured real-time synchronization. This project enhanced my understanding of HL7/ASTM protocols, serial communication, and how middleware can streamline clinical workflows.",
