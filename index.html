            On this voyage, you'll find logs, resources, and systems crafted

            building tools that make our journey smoother. Every module on this
            ship exists to equip you with the knowledge and confidence to take
            on challenges, big or small.

            it's all part of the journey. Remember, every great explorer once
            started with a single step into the unknown. Welcome to the crew —
