            The transistor is the building block of all modern electronic
            devices. It functions as a switch or amplifier and is used to
            control the flow of electrical signals. At the core of modern
            electronics, from your smartphone to high-performance computers,
            lies the transistor — a tiny switch with enormous power.But how does
            it "know" what to do, and how is it able to control the flow of
            electricity with such precision? The answer lies in its ability to
            control electrical current through the properties of semiconductors.
            The Semiconductor Secret The transistor is made of a material called
            semiconductor, typically silicon.
          </p>

          <p>
            Unlike conductors like copper or insulators like rubber,
            semiconductors have electrical properties that can be manipulated by
            the introduction of impurities — a process known as doping. This
            means that the transistor can switch between conducting and
            insulating states depending on the voltage applied to it. This
            ability to control current flow is what makes the transistor so
            powerful. The Structure: Three Layers of Control A typical bipolar
            junction transistor (BJT) consists of three layers: the emitter, the
            base, and the collector.

          <p>
            These layers are each made of different types of semiconductor
            material, either n-type (negative) or p-type (positive). The
            arrangement of these materials is crucial for controlling the flow
            of electricity. Emitter: This is where current enters the
            transistor. Base: A very thin layer of semiconductor material that
            controls the current flowing from the emitter to the collector.
            Collector: The region where current exits the transistor. How It
            Works Think of the transistor as a valve that regulates the flow of
            current.
