            The transistor is the building block of all modern electronic
            devices. It functions as a switch or amplifier and is used to
            control the flow of electrical signals. At the core of modern
            electronics, from your smartphone to high-performance computers,
            lies the transistor — a tiny switch with enormous power.But how does
            it "know" what to do, and how is it able to control the flow of
            electricity with such precision? The answer lies in its ability to
            control electrical current through the properties of semiconductors.
            The Semiconductor Secret The transistor is made of a material called
            semiconductor, typically silicon.
          </p>

          <p style="margin-top: 10px">
            Unlike conductors like copper or insulators like rubber,
            semiconductors have electrical properties that can be manipulated by
            the introduction of impurities — a process known as doping. This
            means that the transistor can switch between conducting and
            insulating states depending on the voltage applied to it. This
            ability to control current flow is what makes the transistor so
            powerful. The Structure: Three Layers of Control A typical bipolar
            junction transistor (BJT) consists of three layers: the emitter, the
            base, and the collector.

        <div>
          <p>
            These layers are each made of different types of semiconductor
            material, either n-type (negative) or p-type (positive). The
            arrangement of these materials is crucial for controlling the flow
            of electricity. Emitter: This is where current enters the
            transistor. Base: A very thin layer of semiconductor material that
            controls the current flowing from the emitter to the collector.
            Collector: The region where current exits the transistor. How It
            Works Think of the transistor as a valve that regulates the flow of
            current.

          Silicon is not fabricated from scratch but rather refined from its
          natural form—silica, which is abundant in sand and quartz. The process
          begins by mixing silica with carbon in an electric arc furnace. At
          temperatures exceeding 2,000°C, the carbon acts as a reducing agent,
          stripping away oxygen from the silica and yielding a crude form of
          silicon known as metallurgical-grade silicon. This initial product
          contains impurities and is subsequently purified through methods such
          as the Siemens process or chemical vapor deposition, especially when
          ultra-high purity is required for semiconductor applications. Thus,

            So, we've got this amazing thing called a transistor—this tiny
            switch made from semiconductor material. But when you put a bunch of
            these switches together in the right way, something truly exciting
            happens: you can build <strong>logic gates</strong>. Now here's the
            big idea — logic gates are the building blocks of thinking machines.
            Yep, your computer, your phone, even your smart toaster — they all
            “think” using these logic gates.
          </p>

          <p>
            A logic gate takes in signals (which are just voltages that mean
            "yes" or "no") and decides what to do with them. For example,
            there's the <strong>AND gate</strong> — it only turns on if *both*
            of its inputs are on. Or the <strong>OR gate </strong>, which turns
            on if *either* input is on. These gates are just little circuits
            made of transistors, wired up in clever ways.

            A <strong>combinational circuit</strong> is a type of digital
            circuit where the output is determined solely by the current inputs
            — there's no memory involved. Unlike sequential circuits that depend
            on past inputs (via stored state), combinational circuits are like
            pure logic machines: input goes in, output comes out instantly.
          </p>

          <p>
            These circuits are built by combining basic logic gates like AND,
            OR, and NOT. Examples include <strong>adders</strong>,
            <strong>multiplexers</strong>, and <strong>encoders</strong>. For
            instance, a half adder takes two binary digits and outputs their sum
            and carry. It’s a key building block for arithmetic operations in
            computers.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Designing a combinational circuit involves choosing the right gates
            and wiring them to get the desired output behavior. You can use
            tools like truth tables, Karnaugh maps, or Boolean algebra to
            simplify and optimize them. Once built, these circuits respond
            immediately to changes in input — no clock needed!

          <p>
            A <strong>register</strong> is a small amount of fast, temporary
            storage inside a CPU used to hold data, addresses, or instructions
            currently being processed. Registers are built from
            <strong>flip-flops</strong>—basic sequential circuits that store a
            single bit of data.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Memory</strong>, on the other hand, refers to larger
            structures that can store vast amounts of data over time. Memory
            units, like RAM or ROM, are constructed from arrays of storage
            cells—each one capable of holding a bit or a group of bits. Unlike
            registers, memory is external to the CPU and communicates through
            buses.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Both registers and memory rely on
            <strong>sequential circuits</strong>, which means they use clock
            signals to synchronize when data is written or read. This allows
            computers to remember past states, a key difference from
            combinational logic. Flip-flops, latches, and timing control are
            critical for making this work.
