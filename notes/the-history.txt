-*- Introduction
- C was not used in the very early days of computing (like in the 1950s and 1960s) to write program such as calculators

1. Early Computers (1950 to 1960s)
- Machine Code and Assembly Language: in the beginning, programmers wrote instructions directly in machine code (binary)
- or in assembly language (more human-readable version of machine code)
- These program are incredibely basic and directly controlled the hardware

2. High-Level Languages (1960s to 1970s)
- As the first high-level programming lagugages were developed (like Fotran and COBOL), it became easier to write complex programs
- these languages allowed programmers to express logic in a more readable way, abstracting away the complexities of the hardware
- Basic was another language that became popular during this time, especially for calcualtors and educational programs.

3. C Language (1972)
- C was created by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 at Bell Labs. It was designed to be a general-purpose language 
- and was used to write Unix, one of the earliest operating systems that could manage hardware and software tasks
- C allowed progrmmers that was portable (i.e. it could run on different machines), unlike assembly languages, which was tied
  to specific hardware

4. Calulator Programs in the C Era (Late 1970s and beyond)
- By the time C was widely used (1970s and 1980s) it was indeed used to write programs like calc. suit. for a vari. of reasons
- c provided a good balance of low level access hardwar and high level hardware making it suitable for a varity of app.
- early scintific graphiv calcult were either programmmed or usd in embbedded c code.
